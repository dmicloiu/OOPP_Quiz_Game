#Notes

[16:45-16:50] **Deadlines mentioned by the TA**

    - HCI Report final version - Friday 18:00
    - Buddy check midterms week - 11 March
    - Midterms week - not so much work but we are advised to work on the project
    - Buddy check resit - in case we don’t complete the Buddy check before the deadline we would have to resit it and it’s not recommended to do so since the resit is harder and it has a higher workload
    - Note that some of the questions in the Buddy check are answered anonymously so we can share thoughts anonymously to the TA

[16:51-16:58] **Standup meeting** - Checking what everyone has done this week

[16:58-17:14] **Workload division discussions**

    - Merge on Sunday
    - Next weeks - contribute during the week so that the progress over the week is visible
    - Write comments for each approval that we do
    - Merge by Monday morning if not on Sunday!!!!
    - Testing - not part of the grade (i.e. small/insignificant part) - unit testing for the entities

    - Implementing scenes

[17:25-17:39] **HCI Report feedback** - The TA gave clear instructions on what we are supposed to change to improve our report

*Methods*
- Link to the prototype - describe the prototype - pick two most important ones for the experts to see - write with words also!!
- Be specific on the number of experts, background, experience
- Clearly mention that we advised the experts to look over the application several times, mention the functionalities they tried
- Be specific about what the experts are supposed to see and for each scene what they are supposed to do and experience


*Results*
- Link the heuristics with the issues they are related to!!
- Short conclusion for the problems part
- Problems with the tools sections needs to be removed

*Conclusion* 
- Summary of the results

*Generalization* 
- If an issue can be solved by changing something group the scenes that the problem is related to and address only that one
