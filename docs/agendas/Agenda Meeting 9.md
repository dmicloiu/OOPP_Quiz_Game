## Agenda items
*The agenda items for this meeting*

[14:50 - 14:55] **{Standup meeting}** – What did we do last week? How did we *cooperate*?

[14:55 - 15:05] **{Tips and tops}** - Everyone has gotten tips and tops form previous week. Share your feedback to the other teammates directly - did they improve upon themselves? Did they address the issues highlighted during previous weeks?

[15:05 - 15:10] **{Division of work}** – Work for this week has been divided. Is everyone still satisfied with what they will be doing? Does the TA accept our choices or do they have any other ideas?

[15.10 - 15.20] **{Demo ideas}** - We have made some ideas for the demo. We will show and discuss these ideas with the TA. Are these ideas good and does the TA
approve of it.

## Action points (for next week) – Who, what, when? [15:20 - 15:25]
*In the next week we focus on all the 'should haves'. This includes making multiplayer functional in the first part of the week.*

## Any other business [15:25 - 15:28]
If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.

## Questions for the TA [15:28 - 15:30]
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*

## Question round [15:30 - 15:32]
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

## Closing [15:32 - 15:35]
*Some motivating words, maybe...*
