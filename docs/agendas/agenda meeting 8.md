## Agenda items
*The agenda items for this meeting*

[13:50-13:55] **{Standup meeting}** – What did we do last week? How did we *cooperate*?

[13:55-14:05] **{Share our progress}** – This week, how did we improve? Is working in our team more enjoyable/productive now? Was the feedback from the TAs helpful in solving our issues? 

[14:05-14:10] **{Division of work}** – Work for this week has been divided. Is everyone still satisfied with what they will be doing? Does the TA accept our choices or do they have any other ideas?

[14:10-14:20] **{Tips and tops}** - Everyone changed somehow. Share your feedback to the other teammates directly - did they improve upon themselves? Did they address the issues highlighted during previous weeks?

## Action points (for next week) – *Who, what, when?* [14:20-14:25]
*The division of work has allowed us to improve our pace and effectiveness. In the coming week, we will focus on closing all "must have" issues and thus making the basic application useable.*

## Any other business [14:25-14:28]
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

## Questions for the TA [14:28-14:30]
*All questions for the TA should be written down or at least known by now. This is the time to ask them.*

## Question round [14:30-14:32]
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

## Closing [14:32-14:35]
*Closing talk.*
