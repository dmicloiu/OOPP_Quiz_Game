## Agenda items
*The agenda items for this meeting*

[15:50-15:55] **{Standup meeting}** – What did we do last week? How did we *cooperate*?

[15:50-16:05] **{Flags}** – What should we try and improve on this week?

[16:05-16:10] **{Tips and tops}** - Everyone changed somehow. Share your feedback to the other teammates directly - did they improve upon themselves? Did they address the issues highlighted during previous weeks?

[16:10-16:15] **{Planning our last week}** – Talk by Alexandra on how we should plan our last week/remaining issues.

[16:15-16:20] **{Division of work}** – Work for this week has been divided. Is everyone still satisfied with what they will be doing? Does the TA accept our choices or do they have any other ideas?

## Action points (for next week) – *Who, what, when?* [16:20-16:25]
*In the coming week, we will focus on closing all "should" issues, fixing all bugs and making the application look prettier, thus finishing the application.*

## Any other business [16:25-16:28]
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

## Questions for the TA [16:28-16:30]
*All questions for the TA should be written down or at least known by now. This is the time to ask them.*

## Question round [16:30-16:32]
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

## Closing [16:32-16:32]
*Closing talk.*
